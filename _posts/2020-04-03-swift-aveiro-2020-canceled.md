We have unfortunately decided to cancel SwiftAveiro 2020. While we were all
very much looking forward to meeting all of you, we don't see an in-person
event as a possibility this year.

We've further decided not to change the format to an online event.

We look forward to seeing you all in a next edition of SwiftAveiro.

Tickets will be refunded. Those who have bought tickets will be notified of the
procedure via email in the following days.

Thank you for understanding.

The SwiftAveiro team
