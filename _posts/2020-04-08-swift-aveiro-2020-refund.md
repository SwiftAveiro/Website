Dear all,

As you may already be aware, we have decided to cancel this year's edition of
SwiftAveiro in light of the recent pandemic currently sweeping the globe. This
was a tough decision to make but, frankly speaking, we cannot predict how
things will be in June and therefore cancelling is the safest course of action
for all of us.

As such, we will refund every ticket purchased. The full amount will be sent
via bank transfer to the account associated with the card that was used for the
purchase.

We will start refunding tickets today and transfers should start going through
in the next couple of days.

With regards to invoices:
- you can download an updated, cancelled invoice directly from Ti.to (our
ticketing platform) 
- due to legal reasons, Portuguese nationals will also be sent via email a
credit note generated using a pre-approved software program

Should any question arrive please drop us a line at: swiftaveiro@gmail.com

We hope you understand and we look forward to seeing you all next year.

Stay safe,

The SwiftAveiro team
