          While in Portugal, we'd recommend you to take the opportunity to get a taste of what it offers, like enjoying Porto's Midsummer festival!
        </p>
        <h4>Tuesday June 23</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Arrive in Porto and explore the city! At night, Porto's Midsummer festival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festa_de_SÃ£o_JoÃ£o_do_Porto">SÃ£o JoÃ£o</a> will take place. It's a real experience, where you hit people on their heads with plastic hammers. ðŸ”¨<br />
          Maybe grab a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesinha">Francesinha</a> or XYZ for dinner?
        </p>
        <h4>Wednesday June 24</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          After recovering from SÃ£o JoÃ£o, you can head down to Aveiro by train. Seafood here is great, so those dinner plans should be sorted!
        </p>
        <h4>Thursday June 25</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Conference time! There'll be lunch, as well as an organized dinner and party in the evening. Time to learn and make friends!
        </p>
        <h4>Friday June 26</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Day two of workshops! Lunch is again provided. Maybe find a nice restaurant in the city with some of those friends you made yesterday and today?
        </p>
        <h4>Saturday June 27</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          We'll host some activities on Saturday that you'll surely not want to miss. After some hard work, you deserve laying back and getting to know the people through some outdoor activities.
        </p>
        <h4>Sunday June 28</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Time to head back to Porto and then home...
