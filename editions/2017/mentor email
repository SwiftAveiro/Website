Good morning folks, how is everyone?

Apologies for sending this email so late in the game, we've been wanting to do it sooner but circumstances have not really allowed it.

So, we're just a couple of days away from the event and, again, we'd just like to thank everyone for accepting our invitation. It's a pretty big step for us but, then again, if we're not a little bit scared of what we're doing on our day-to-day lifes then we're really growing and learning ;)

Moving on, we've made some reservations for each day of the conference (plus Wednesday). There are some cool restaurants nearby and we hope you'll be pleased. For Wednesday, the reservation is scheduled for 8:30PM (we tend to have dinner a bit later than the US/UK over here).

Here is the schedule of the conference by the way:

Day 1:
08:00 - 09:00: Registration
09:00 - 09:10: Short Introduction
09:10 - 10:15: Mentors' pitches
10:15 - 10:30: Coffee Break
10:30 - 12:30: Workshops - first session
12:30 - 14:30: Lunch
14:30 - 16:30: Workshops - second session
16:30 - 16:50: Coffee Break
16:50 - 18:50: Workshops - third session

We'll be having dinner at 20:30 and there will be a party starting at 22:30 ~ 11:00

Day 2:
09:00 - 10:00: Mentors' pitches
10:00 - 10:15: Coffee Break
10:15 - 12:15: Workshops - first session
12:15 - 14:15: Lunch
14:15 - 16:15: Workshops - second session
16:15 - 16:30: Coffee Break
16:30 - 18:30: Workshops - third session
18:30 - 18:35: Conclusion

As you can see, we want to do a small 5m pitch for each mentor each day. The idea is to allow attendees to find out more about your proposed workshop. This is important because they can only attend 3 workshops out of 6. Don't worry too much about making slides and whatnot; a short and clear verbal introduction can be just as effective. In any case, we'll have a projector nearby.

You'll also work only for a single day. We think it's best if mentors that have experienced this format go first; this way, newcomers can potentially learn some tips and tricks that may help their own workshop.

By the way, our tips are:
	1) Get a sample project on Github that everyone in order to minimize boilerplate. Time is really limited.

	2) Interact frequently with everyone; mentoring is substancially different from speaking

	3) If you run into any issue, come find the staff. We'll fix it!

Here is our proposal for each day. 
If you prefer to swap do let us know, we're totally cool with it.

Day 1:
- Sally Shepard
- Orta Therox
- Rui Peres
- Jorge Ortiz
- Benjamin Encz
- Junior Bonto

Day 2:
- David Rodrigues
- Vijaya Kantel
- Greg Heo
- Ellen Shapiro
- Ivan Bruel
- Francisco Costa

Again, all workshops that happen on a given day will be running in parallel. We've booked two rooms and the smaller one could potentially be useful for workshops that require constant verbal communication between attendees and mentors (Junior, it could be quite useful for your workshop for instance).

We won't lie, it's significantly uglier though :p If you prefer a quieter room, let us know and we'll put you there. We can also rotate tables, that way you don't have to spend the entire day in the same place (although it would cause a bit of a mess for the attendees, but they'll get by).

Thanks for your time and if you need anything drop us a line OK?
All the best, we're super excited :D
